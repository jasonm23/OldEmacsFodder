For convenience, I've built a couple of OS X binaries of Emacs24.1.5, 

First, built with Lion OS X 10.7.4 and patched to use Lion's new
fullscreen mode, I have tested it only on 10.7.4 (in fact I'm writing
this post with it.) but, personally I prefer the old
`ns-toggle-fullscreen` style of Fullscreen, as I use multiple
monitors. However, it's useful if you have one screen and prefer the
Mission control screen swiping style. Non Mac users, suspend your
teeth nashing.

The binary can be downloaded from here:

*(You'll need 7z/tar to uncompress it, [The Unarchiver](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html) will do the trick.)*

I've also built a 10.6.8 (and up) compatible build of Emacs24.1.5
with the older `ns-toggle-fullscreen` patch, which does non-exclusive
fullscreen, TBH, I'd recommend you get this one unless you're *really*
wanting the little Lion OS X fullscreen window widget.

It's quite possible to get the same mission control style operation,
but you'll need to drag it to it's own space... yeah, I know, the
things I make you do.

The link for this binary is:

Ok, so that's the first post here. Enjoy.

Coming soon, `powerline.el` with some new styling addons.
