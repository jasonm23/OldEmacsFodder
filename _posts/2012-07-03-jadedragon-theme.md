Having recently switched to the Emacs24 load-theme / deftheme system,
has encouraged me to convert some of my color-theme efforts from a few
years ago.

I have a
[collection of themes here](http://jasonm23.github.com/#emacs-themes)
and a
[color-theme editor](http://jasonm23.github.com/#emacs-theme-editor)
which work ok, even though they're a bit simplistic.  The color-theme
editor works very well (it's crowbarred specifically for this
purpose.) with the *random* theme generator over at
[themes.sweyla.com](http://themes.sweyla.com).  And I have a disorder
that can prompt me to switch color themes as often as once every couple of weeks.

The one theme I have stuck with most often, when I'm not going
[all orange](http://jasonm23.github.com/EmacsFodder/Emacs/2012/07/02/tangerine-theme)
is this one, Jade Dragon, it's a dark theme, with cool color tones,
blues, greens and shades of turquiose. Anyway, rather than get overly
lyrical, or try to convince you it's scientifically proven to improve
your coding experience, I'll just put some screen-shots here.
